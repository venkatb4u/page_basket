# Page_Basket

A scalable web boilerplate for anyone who's in need to kickstart developing webpages using html, css and javascript. 

## Why this?

This is to achieve maintaining a generic codebase throughout the development, facilitating reusability of components (be it styles or javascript based).

## Benefits?

* `Separation of concern` is the key that it holds throughout.
* Maintainability.
* `Microservice` way of codebase structuring. (Yes, definitely not the `monolithic` pattern)
* Loading assets on demand -- reduced network loads -- quick page rendering. (Yes, AMD'ish way is also available)
